This study examines the trend of programming contest participation in Pakistan, specifically focusing on the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) in 2021, including online, regional, and world finals. The results indicate that certain universities in Pakistan had low participation rates and a low win ratio compared to other Universities in both the Online Preliminary and On-site Regionals of 2021. The study identifies that the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences Islamabad, NU-FAST Karachi, and Punjab Universities had the best win ratios throughout 2021 that was 40%, 25%, and 19% respectively in the ICPC 2021 regional finals. Following up their same sequence from ICPC Online preliminary round 2021. There are several correlations that may contribute to this trend, such as consistent contest participation and the number of teams sent to contests per institution.

### Pakistan in Comparison with Bangladesh

Furthermore, Pakistan's participation metrics have been compared to that of Bangladesh and it was observed that the number of teams participating, in the ICPC 2021 preliminary, from Pakistan is 89% less than Bangladesh. With 1819 teams were seen participating from Bangladesh while only 191 teams from Pakistan took part. This decline was severely backed by the fact that only 34 institutes took part in the ICPC 2021 from Pakistan while 117 institutes dispatched multiple teams from Bangladesh which is 70% more than Pakistan. This is a very important factor to note given Pakistan's population is about 36.6% more than Bangladesh according to the world bank estimates for 2021.
